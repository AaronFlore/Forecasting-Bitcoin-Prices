# Forecasting-Bitcoin-Prices (ARIMA, XGBoost, Prophet, LSTM)
Forecasting Bitcoin Prices via ARIMA, XGBoost, Prophet, and LSTM models in Python.
Description: In this repo, I will test the Bitcoin forecasting abilities of 4 different Machine Learning models in Python: ARIMA, Prophet, XGBoost, and LSTM. By splitting the data into a testing and training set, I will compare each modelâ€™s performance with one another and conclude which performed best.
